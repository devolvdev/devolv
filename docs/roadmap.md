# 📍 Devolv Roadmap

Devolv is a modular DevOps CLI being released in public, one tool at a time.

---

## ✅ Live

- `devolv validate file` → Validate a single IAM JSON/YAML file
- `devolv validate folder` → Recursively validate IAM files in a directory
- `devolv drift` → Detect IAM policy drift between local files and AWS

---

## 🛠️ In Progress

- `devolv scan` → Scan AWS accounts for policy misuse and misconfigurations
- `devolv generate` → Generate least-privilege IAM policies using logs/templates
- `devolv etl` → Transform and clean IAM data for use in CI/CD or analysis pipelines

---

## 🧪 Long Term Vision

- 🤖 DevSecOps AI Agent: Auto-review IAM PRs and detect risky changes
- 🔁 GitHub Bot: Inline comments on IAM policy diffs
- 📊 SaaS Dashboard: Central governance, audit trails, and policy history
- 🧠 Neural IAM Optimizer: Learn from past usage to suggest least privilege
