# 📍 Devolv Roadmap

**Devolv is a modular DevOps security-first platform, built for CI/CD automation and scalable governance.** Each tool is released in public, one module at a time.

---

## ✅ Live (CI/CD-first tools)

- `devolv validate file` → Recursively validate IAM files in a directory
- `devolv drift` → Detect IAM policy drift between local files and AWS (auto-PR creation supported)

---

## 🛠️ In Progress

- `devolv scan` → Scan AWS accounts for policy misuse and misconfigurations
- `devolv generate` → Generate least-privilege IAM policies using logs/templates
- `devolv etl` → Transform and clean IAM data for use in CI/CD or analysis pipelines

---

## 🧪 Long Term Vision

- 🤖 **DevSecOps AI Agent** → Auto-review IAM PRs and detect risky changes in CI/CD
- 🔁 **GitHub Bot** → Inline comments on IAM policy diffs, enforce standards in PRs
- 📊 **SaaS Dashboard** → Central governance, audit trails, policy history, and insights
- 🧠 **Neural IAM Optimizer** → Learn from usage patterns and recommend least-privilege policies
