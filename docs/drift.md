# Devolv Drift ‚Äî CI/CD-First IAM Policy Drift Detection

`devolv drift` is a **CI/CD-first tool** that automatically detects IAM policy drift between your local files and deployed AWS IAM policies. It is designed primarily for automated pipelines, with local CLI use as a secondary option.

---

## üöÄ Why Devolv Drift in CI/CD?

‚úÖ Automate IAM drift detection on every PR, push, or merge  
‚úÖ Auto-create PRs or issues to resolve drift  
‚úÖ No manual AWS console checks  
‚úÖ Secure OIDC-based AWS access ‚Äî no long-term credentials  

üëâ **CI/CD is the primary use case** ‚Äî local CLI use is optional for manual checks.

---

## üì¶ How to Get Started

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Install Devolv (for local CLI use)**

```bash
pip install devolv
```
‚úÖ Required if you want to run `devolv drift` manually outside CI/CD.

‚ö† **Note:** In CI/CD, installation is typically handled by your workflow or container image ‚Äî you don't need to install it manually.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Set Up AWS OIDC Role for GitHub Actions**

Download our onboarding script:  
https://github.com/devolvdev/devolv-actions/blob/main/devolv_oidc_onboard.py  

Download via terminal:
```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devolvdev/devolv-actions/main/devolv_oidc_onboard.py
```
Run in **AWS CloudShell** or any AWS CLI-authenticated machine:
```bash
python devolv_oidc_onboard.py --github-org YourOrgName
```
‚úÖ This will:
- Set up the OIDC provider (if missing)
- Create an IAM role trusted for your GitHub org
- Attach IAM policy permissions needed by Devolv Drift
- Output the role ARN + a GitHub Actions block

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Add GitHub Actions Workflow**

Create a file at:
```
.github/workflows/devolv-drift.yml
```
Example contents:
```yaml
permissions:
  id-token: write
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write
  issues: write

jobs:
  drift-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
        with:
          role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::<account_id>:role/YourOrg-DevolvRole
          aws-region: us-east-1

      - name: Run Devolv Drift
        uses: devolvdev/devolv-actions@v2
        with:
          tool: drift
          policy-name: DevolvTestPolicy
          path: ./test-devolv-policy.json
          approvers: ""                  # Empty by default; pass comma-separated list if needed
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          approval-anyway: false        # false by default; 

```

‚úÖ **‚ö† Mandatory repository setting:**  
In your GitHub repository settings under **Actions ‚Üí General ‚Üí actions**, ensure you enable:
```
‚òë Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests
```
This is required for Devolv Drift to auto-create PRs.

---

## üìù What Devolv Drift Does in CI/CD

‚úÖ Checks your local IAM policy files against live AWS policies  
‚úÖ Shows a rich, colorized diff of detected drift in workflow logs  
‚úÖ Automatically opens PRs to sync your code or propose AWS updates  
‚úÖ Optionally opens issues to track drift findings  

---

## ‚ö° Final Checklist for Success

‚úÖ Devolv installed (`pip install devolv`) for local CLI use  
‚úÖ OIDC AWS role set up using `devolv_oidc_onboard.py`  
‚úÖ Workflow file includes correct `permissions:` block  
‚úÖ Repository setting enabled to allow Actions to create/approve PRs  
‚úÖ Role trust and policy match your GitHub org + IAM needs  
‚úÖ Devolv Drift runs on every PR / push in your workflow
